= Linux =
Download source code and extract to a folder called blake, then you have to run the next commands.
{{{
cd blake
phpize
./configure
make
make test
make install
}}}

Add "extension" directive to php.ini as follows:
{{{
extension=blake.so
}}}

= Windows =
Compilation in Windows is harder and requires:
  * Microsoft Visual C++ (6.0 or 9)
  * Windows SDK
  * Some binary tools

The [http://wiki.php.net/internals/windows/stepbystepbuild wiki site of PHP] describes perfectly how to build PHP and PECL extensions step by step.
